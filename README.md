# Artist GifTastic

This is the 6th assignment for my coding boot camp.

In this assignment, I used GIPHY API to make a dynamic website that allows a user to populate different gifs based on the search name.  

This site is hosted at https://jgwynn36.github.io/best-artist-gifs/

## Getting Started

The theme for this site is the best artist.  I have already add some of my favorite artist to the search bar.  I hope you enjoy searching for GIFS.

### Instructions

Enter an artist name or select one of the pre populated names click on the name and the GIFS will display.  Hover over the GIFS or click it and it will play.

## Technology Used

* HTML
